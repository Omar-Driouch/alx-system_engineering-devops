# Website Outage Incident Postmortem

## Issue Summary

- **Duration:** The outage occurred from 2024-03-08 15:00 UTC to 2024-03-08 18:30 UTC.
- **Impact:** The website's main landing page and user authentication services were unavailable during the outage. Approximately 75% of users experienced slow or failed login attempts, resulting in frustration and a notable decline in user engagement.
- **Root Cause:** The outage was caused by a sudden surge in traffic due to a marketing campaign launch coinciding with an unexpected increase in bot traffic targeting the authentication service.

## Timeline

- **15:00 UTC:** The issue was detected when the monitoring system triggered alerts for increased server load and elevated error rates in authentication requests.
- **15:15 UTC:** Engineering team members noticed a spike in error logs related to database connection failures.
- **15:30 UTC:** Initial investigation focused on network infrastructure and database configurations, assuming a possible database overload due to legitimate user traffic.
- **16:00 UTC:** Realized the database was not the bottleneck; further analysis revealed a significant volume of suspicious traffic patterns consistent with bot activity.
- **16:30 UTC:** Incident escalated to the DevOps team to implement temporary rate limiting on authentication requests to mitigate the impact of bot traffic.
- **18:00 UTC:** With the rate limiting in place, legitimate user traffic was restored to normal levels, and error rates began to decline.
- **18:30 UTC:** The outage was resolved by implementing more robust bot detection mechanisms and refining the rate-limiting strategy to maintain service availability during future traffic spikes.

## Root Cause and Resolution

- **Root Cause Explanation:** The website outage stemmed from a combination of factors, including a sudden increase in legitimate traffic from a marketing campaign and a concurrent influx of bot traffic targeting the authentication service. This unexpected surge overwhelmed the system's capacity to handle authentication requests, leading to service degradation.
- **Resolution Details:** The immediate resolution involved implementing temporary rate limiting on authentication requests to alleviate the strain on the system. Long-term measures included enhancing bot detection mechanisms and optimizing server infrastructure to better handle sudden traffic spikes.

## Corrective and Preventative Measures

- **Improvements/Fixes:** 
  - Enhance bot detection mechanisms to differentiate between legitimate and malicious traffic effectively.
  - Optimize server infrastructure to handle sudden traffic spikes more gracefully, ensuring service availability during peak usage periods.
- **Tasks to Address the Issue:**
  1. Refine rate-limiting strategies to dynamically adjust thresholds based on real-time traffic patterns.
  2. Implement proactive monitoring for anomalous traffic behavior to detect and mitigate potential issues before they impact service availability.
  3. Conduct a comprehensive review of marketing campaign schedules to better anticipate and prepare for traffic surges.
  4. Collaborate with security experts to further strengthen defenses against bot attacks and unauthorized access attempts.
